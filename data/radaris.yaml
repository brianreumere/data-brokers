    workaround: The control form advises you to email `removals@radaris.com`. However, Radaris customer service claims, "you will need to identify the specific personal information, and provide proof of identity along with evidence of your current state's residency status." Treat this on a case-by-case basis, and consider only following through with their absurd removal process if they are listing extremely sensitive info about you.
